# two-firewatch

Based on https://github.com/rakr/vim-two-firewatch

This is still really early in development. I hope to eventually have it more stable.

## Running

`npm run build` will build the theme.
`npm run dev` will build the theme and watch for changes.

## Current Plan

- [ ] Stabilize around the current colors
- [ ] Make a minimal and a full version
  - I prefer minimal coloring, but I also want a faithful recreation of the original theme
- [ ] Audit the light theme
- [ ] Flesh out TS/JS support
- [ ] Flesh out jupyter support

# two-firewatch -- WIP

Based on https://github.com/rakr/vim-two-firewatch

## Running, either vscode or warp

`npm run build` will build the theme.

## Current Plan
### VSCode
- [ ] Stabilize around the current colors
- [ ] Make a minimal and a full version
  - I prefer minimal coloring, but I also want a faithful recreation of the original theme
- [ ] Audit the light theme
- [ ] Flesh out TS/JS support
- [ ] Flesh out jupyter support
### Warp
- [ ] Clean up the colors to use actual duotone, not just the ansi colors
### Meta
- [ ] probably use something like lerna to simplify dependencies
